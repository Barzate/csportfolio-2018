    <h2> What did you create? </h2>
    <p> I created a page where you can hear songs and have choices of four songs .
</p>
    <img src="">
    
    <h2> How does the project work overall? </h2>
    <p> so there's a drop down where the fours songs are , and a play and pause button . 
 </p>

    <h2>What are some specifics of the code and how do those work?</h2>
    <p>We created four audio objects in the html file which imports the songs i downloaded into the same folder .i imported the elementbyid into javascript. i manipulated those audio objects in javascript using the .play .pause function .  
</p>

    <h2>What choices did you have to make and how did you go about making them?
</h2>
<p> i chose the drop down bar to hear all the songs instead of having to individually choose them one by one . 
</p>

<h2>How has this project changed your connection and understanding of what it means to interact with something?
What is one thing you would change if you had more time?
</h2>
<p>one thing ill change if i had more time is to make a more complex or more creative type of proect. i got somewhat of an understanding , i now know that everything has to be really precise becauase and no erros por spelling erros .</p>
